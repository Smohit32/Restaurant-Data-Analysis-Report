# Restaurant-Data-Analysis-Report

### Overview
During my Level 1 , 2 internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I conducted an in-depth analysis of restaurant datasets using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Tasks included analyzing top cuisines, city-wise distribution, price range dynamics , Restaurant ratings , Cuisine Combination and Restaurant chains. This project honed my data analysis skills and provided practical insights into optimizing business strategies in the restaurant industry.

### Key Tasks Accomplished:

### Level 1 
Top Cuisines Analysis 🍲: Using Python and Pandas, I identified the most popular cuisines among customers, shedding light on preferences and trends that could influence menu offerings.
1 - Determine the top three most common cuisines in the dataset.
2 - Calculated the percentage of restaurants that serve each of the top cuisines.

City Analysis 🏙️: Leveraging Python along with Matplotlib and Seaborn, I conducted an in-depth geographical analysis to understand restaurant distribution across different cities. This analysis uncovered regional preferences and helped identify potential expansion opportunities.
1 - Identified the city with the highest number of restaurants in the dataset.
2 - Calculated the average rating forrestaurants in each city.
3 - Determined the city with the highest average rating.

Price Range Distribution 💰: Employing Python's data manipulation capabilities and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I examined the distribution of restaurant price ranges. This analysis provided insights into pricing strategies and customer segmentation.
1 - Created a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of price ranges among the restaurants.
2 - Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

Online Delivery Analysis🛵: I investigated trends in online delivery services within the restaurant industry, providing insights into consumer behavior and operational implications.
1 - Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery.
2 - Compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

### Level 2
Task: Restaurant Ratings

1. Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings and determined the most commonrating range.
2.Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.

Task: Cuisine Combination

3.Identified the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset.
4. Determined if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.
  
Task: Restaurant Chains

5.Identifed if there are any restaurant chains present in the dataset.
6.Analyzed the ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.

### Tools and Methods Used:
Python 🐍: Python served as the cornerstone of this project, allowing me to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization efficiently.
Pandas 🐼: I utilized Pandas extensively for data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation tasks.
Visualization 📊: Matplotlib and Seaborn helped me create insightful charts and graphs to present findings effectively.

### Conclusion:
Through comprehensive data analysis using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I uncovered valuable insights into the restaurant industry. The analysis revealed the most popular cuisines among customers, regional variations in dining preferences, distribution of price ranges across different establishments, and evolving trends in online delivery services. These insights are crucial for restaurant owners and stakeholders to optimize menu offerings, pricing strategies, and operational efficiencies. By leveraging data-driven decisions, restaurants can better cater to customer preferences and navigate competitive landscapes effectively.
